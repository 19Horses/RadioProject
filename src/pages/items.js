    "description": "<p><b>Freedom</b> is consumed under the pretence that it is unlimited; there is no such thing as being “too free”. Quite the contrary, <strong><b>freedom</b> is the ultimate end, the manifestation of the good, the absence of all evil.</strong> The happy man is free, the free man is happy. But the word <b>freedom</b> is to humans what the bell is for Pavlov’s dogs. We rarely question what <b>freedom</b> is, who provides it, or the cost that <b>freedom</b> is priced at. We indulge in it, consume it to its fullest, then cry for more. Like dogs, we eat what's served, beg for seconds, and thank our owner.<br/><br/>The free-market economy claimed to increase employment, social mobility, choice of goods, and education, and therefore sustain higher degrees of <b>freedom</b>, compared to the heavily constricting traditional class hierarchies of the pre-industrial revolution. Its development has ultimately achieved the opposite; the subjugation of the individual into an economically productive tool that is utilised to serve as a means to the end of the dominating institutions. As H. Marcuse predicted in the 1950s, the advanced capitalist society that supposedly increases liberty due to its “non-interventionist” ideology, measures <b>freedom</b> through economic activity; the access to material goods and the possession thereof. The illusion of choice then projects <b>freedom</b>, but ultimately, <strong>the only <b>freedom</b> the individual is granted is committing to the same orders that sustain these oppressive economic structures.</strong> Critical immaterial properties that constitute <b>freedom</b>, such as rights, individuality, liberty of thought, and its expression, may be met, but have lost their function in society. Rather, the extent to which the individual may participate unrestrictedly in the economy through the obtaining of monetary and material goods prevails over the essence of <b>freedom</b>.<br/><br/> Variety of choice has therefore become the ultimate quantification of <b>freedom</b>; how extensive is the pool of goods you can choose from, and how much of that can you call your own? If <b>freedom</b> is derived from the free-market, you must participate to claim this liberty. The culture of mass-consumption then illusions individuals to be free in the Western civilization, as they are flooded with choices of material goods. The equation is simple: if the free market ensures your <b>freedom</b>, the more access you have, the greater your <b>freedom</b>. Therefore, needless variations of the same product are promoted, creating the illusion of innumerable choices to parallelly manifest unlimited <b>freedom</b>. Whilst individuals externalise <b>freedom</b> through the arbitrary choices made, their initial participation in the market was nothing but forced. <strong>It does not matter what choice is made, only that a choice is made, repeatedly, consistently, and frequently. The pressure to submit to mass-consumption is severe; advertisements are pushed constantly, products are too cheap, trends change weekly.</strong> Consumption of goods is centralised in the current means of existence, even if it’s inefficient or unproductive to the individual. Meanwhile, attention is sold as a commodity, and individuals will passively neglect demands for immaterial <b>freedoms</b>. “Independence of thought, autonomy, and the right to political opposition” are all properties that come at the cost of endless indulgence into consumption. The illusion of <b>freedom</b> through arbitrary choices keeps the people tamed, obedient, distracted. As long as they are sufficiently entertained, fed, and kept far enough from the ugly, no threat to those whose products are consumed is posed.<br/><br/> This sounds like a conspiracy theory. Because, ultimately, people still claim their immaterial <b>freedoms</b>; we protest, we complain, we educate ourselves. But the economic system establishes the realm within which the individual may exist without risking the status quo; <strong>you may be angry, as long as your anger does not threaten to destabilize the current structures.</strong> The change you may enact is through increased commitment to the same structures that subject you as a means to their end; political candidates, policy changes, all embodying the same economic structures, only varying versions thereof. Rational contention must occur through positive improvements of the same mechanisms that structure the economic system, which thereby strengthens itself through claiming higher satisfaction with the individual and gaining legitimacy. <strong>The individual is granted as much executive decision-making power that satisfies her own demand for believing to have agency over her life in the political sphere.</strong> The only power the individual truly possesses is her function as an economic subject, being a minor fragment of the larger unit. Effective protest can thus only be expressed through the aggravated rejection of this function. This is evident as through the newly introduced Anti-Boycott Bill, the individual is prohibited to even freely choose how to economically participate. The paradoxical nature of a free-market economy that prohibits free economic activity should illuminate a glimpse of how individual liberty is not the primary end of capitalism.<br/><br/><strong>We are convinced to be free, yet all fall victim to the traps of consumption.</strong> Alienated from our morality, we look past the horrors of production, the path to destruction we are firmly walking, and our own kind we are sacrificing on the way. Why can’t we stop buying iPhones or use Instagram? Why are we glued to a screen seven hours a day? Why do we own 21 different t-shirts? When it is so difficult to refuse to participate in useless consumption despite realising its harm, we must question its appeal to liberty. <strong>Consumption is intentional, just not by the consumer.</strong> If humanity is meant to be free in a free-market society, how have we become so passive?  </p>",

Whatever one prefers, though, calling me Manny seems to be reserved for those who have known me for many years, so use it at your own discretion. I’m a 25-year-old pop artist now based in Angel. I used to live in Wood Green, so… rags to riches, I guess. I work in a music studio in Soho and I’m also a piano teacher for kids. I also just got married… what a life.”<br/><br/><br/><strong>RP: Which artists, albums, or experiences inspired and influenced your musical direction?</strong><br/>EBK: “Ooooooh okay, this is where I need to show some restraint, or I will go on an endless tangent about music and its influence on me. So, in terms of artists, I’m a huge fan of Tyler, the Creator. He was the first artist who made me want to become an artist. I remember listening to “IGOR” for the second time on its release day… that was the day I started my music journey to becoming an artist. The 1975 are probably tied with Tyler in terms of how much their music and their existence have changed my life. What they have done to pop music, more specifically introducing a genre-less approach to pop music, as well as their own personal discography and artistry, has really helped shape the way I tackle melodies, performances, song-writing, production, etc. “A Brief Inquiry Into Only Relationships” is the album that made me a fan and is an album I sometimes come back to when I need inspiration.”<br/> <br/>EBK: ““Stop Making Sense” by Talking Heads, “beatopia” by Beabadoobee, “Here Comes The Cowboy” by Mac DeMarco, “Sound Of Silver” by LCD Soundsystem, and “PANG” by Caroline Polachek; all of these albums reshaped my views on music and my own artistry and helped me to understand that there was no need of boxing myself in.”<br/><br/><br/><strong>RP: ”Jesus Hates My Porn Addiction” feels both deeply personal and a commentary on religious attitudes toward sexuality. What inspired you to explore such a vulnerable theme, and how do you see that balance between personal storytelling and broader critique?</strong><br/>EBK: “Honestly, I don’t know. I think a lot of people were expecting a massive answer in terms of why I wrote the song, most people boiling it down to some sort of moral duty as a Christian to talk about these taboo topics. The existence of the song legitimately comes down to a writing exercise. I just wanted to write a song, and I wrote the line “I’ve got to get this off my chest, I’d never seen a pair of breasts.” So I committed to finishing off the song, and here we are. Between you, me (and whoever reads this), if I’m writing about something, it’s probably because I’ve already gone through, dealt with it, and, therefore, have no attachment to it anymore. I never thought, “Oh no, this is very exposing, what if people have thoughts?” I don’t really find it exposing because… I don’t really care anymore about it; the porn addiction is behind me. It’s not my life anymore. It’s simple, just a piece of art that I created.”<br/><br/><br/><strong>RP: How has your own experience with the tension between sexuality and religion shaped you, and what have you learned, or are you still learning from navigating that conflict?</strong><br/>EBK: “I grew up a very sheltered kid, but quite accidentally. I don’t think my mother was intentionally stopping me from listening to the radio, for example, but she wasn’t rushing to switch it on, and I wasn’t a curious kid either. So, during my teenage years, though I’d experience the sensation of, let’s say, horniness, I didn’t have the terminology for it, nor did I have any understanding of what or why it was happening. Therefore, it became quite (internally) demonised. Which made engaging with Christianity a lot easier since I kinda just was under the assumption that I don’t get tempted. It’s funny, the line “I felt like Adam, you were Eve, I bit the apple from the tree” really describes the start of my complicated relationship with my faith and sexual desire. I first engaged in sexual activity when I was 18. From that point, I really found out how hard lust and temptation were to overcome. Then I started masturbating at 21. Then I started watching porn at 22. At all those points, I still loved Jesus; I just found myself falling deeper and deeper into territory that I had no tactics to deal with. And then, at some point, the cycle begins of “oooooh, I enjoy watching porn and masturbating, but I know God isn’t happy, maybe I’ll do it one more time, and then I’ll stop. Oh gosh, why did I do it AGAIN? God must hate me. I hate me. Urgh, I’m never going to do that again. But oooooh, I enjoy…”. I really hated myself for a year, between the summer of 2022 and the end of 2023. But, after speaking to many friends and older humans, I kinda just learned to take it easier on myself. I learned to address my problem as an addiction, but to have grace on myself because overcoming an addiction is very difficult. I learned to be patient with my humanity because my newfound realisation that “porn is bad” didn’t always translate into my actions, which is understandable because humans do stuff that they shouldn’t do and stuff they don’t want to do. (There’s a verse in the Bible about this sort of problem, somewhere in Romans, good read.) Basically, I learned to love myself because God still loves me despite my shortcomings, which are many, and He continuously believes in me to do the right thing. Right now, I don’t have a porn addiction. I can easily function without watching porn.”<br/> <br/> <strong>RP: Many religions, including Christianity, have strong views on pornography… how have those teachings influenced your personal understanding of desire, guilt, or morality?</strong><br/>EBK: “Not to blame the church or people, but it’s super easy to build up these guilt complexes because, although these things are spoken about, it’s rare, and it’s super easy for people to assimilate the behaviour of a “good Christian”. Being in a church environment can sometimes feel like being on stage with a whole lot of performers who don’t want to be seen as human or sinners or weak, so they try to convince everybody that their life is going good. I know because I’ve done it before. And, for some reason, it’s super easy to buy into these performances as the truth; therefore, I remember leaving church many times feeling super insecure about my relationship with God and super guilty because “I guess it’s just me who’s dealing with this addiction,” which is just a lie. There are probably at least 2 people in every friendship circle who are dealing with a porn addiction, yet everyone bears the shame of being the “only one”. Weird. Now, conviction? That’s another topic. And one thing being at church did for me was help me remember my convictions. It reminded me that I actually don’t want to live life like this. That it’s not okay for me to live life completely dependent on “gooning”. And it’s given me a massive sense of humility and grace. I don’t have much of my own morality. The little I do are things like being kind, being helpful, the really basic human stuff. That’s where it ends. If I had much of my own moral code, I’d still be masterbating every day and night because I could justify it with this logic, “It’s not harming anybody, it’s only affecting myself, and it’s making me ‘happy’ so why not?!” A lot of the moral code I do tend to adhere by is based on Jesus. He's the best role model I know, quite the cringe sentence, but one of upmost sincerity. I also do not think I’m better than anybody else on this Earth. I do not see myself as holier or a better Christian than others who are dealing with this. I have endless amounts of grace and empathy for those who are trying to fight their demons.”<br/> <br/> <strong>RP: You reference Matthew 5:29 in the song... what does that verse mean to you personally, and why did you choose to highlight it?</strong><br/>EBK: “Not much really, hahaha, I kinda just thought I would be a clever chorus line. The imagery of “if anything is causing you to sin, cut it off or remove it” is fascinating to me. How far are we willing to avoid doing the wrong thing? Funnily enough, now that I’m writing this, I do remember at some point in my porn addiction, thinking, “… what if I just chopped off my penis? Wouldn’t that stop the problem?” I obviously decided against doing so… thank God. So maybe the Matthew bible verse came subconsciously from that memory. Who knows?”<br/> <br/> <strong>RP: Your next release is coming at the end of August... what can listeners look forward to?</strong><br/>EBK: “You guys can look forward to a short but sweet EP. You’ve already heard two of the songs on there. The other two are quite tender and sincere. My favourite one is “Will You Be My Friend?” I kinda wrote it after being on FaceTime with two of my best friends, after having just celebrated my birthday. There aren’t many songs written about friendship, so… yeah…”<br/> <br/> <strong>RP: “Speech marks are an indication of my irony”... What does this mean to you?</strong><br/>EBK: “Well, the full title is “Speech marks an an indication of my irony… There are no speech marks.” After I wrote “Jesus Hates…”, I remember trying to come up with a title, and a conversation came to mind where I had used speech marks via text to imply sarcasm/irony, and the person didn’t understand why I did, citing that there was another form of expressing irony that she was more used to. I thought it would be funny to lean into that here, whenever you saw speech marks. But that’s the thing; there are no speech marks. I am in no way being sarcastic, or ironic, or sardonic, or clever, or whatever synonyms you could find. “There’s Something Wrong With Me”, “Jesus Hates…”, “Comfort”, “Will You Be My Friend?”, “This Feeling”; all of these songs are so sincere and earnest and honest. Now the meta joke here is… speech marks have to be used when quoting these songs, so… am I being sarcastic? Am I being honest? Is this all one big gag to make people insert the speech marks for me? No. But…”</p>",
